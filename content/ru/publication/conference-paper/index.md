abstract: Network routers use queue management algorithms to ensure a high level of Quality of Service (QoS). This ensures efficient allocation of network bandwidth and meets user requirements for data transfer speeds and reliability. Various control algorithms have been used to date. Within the scope of this work, we have conducted a performance analysis of Random Early Detection (RED), including its various modifications, through complex modeling. Our analysis includes a comparison to other queue management techniques using criteria such as queue length, latency, variability of latency, and window sizing for TCP protocol types such as Reno and Vegas. The use of simulation based analysis on the NS-2 simulator allows us to accurately evaluate the performance and efficacy of various RED algorithm settings and implementations. We modified the source code of the NS-2 simulator to conduct simulation‐based analyses.
